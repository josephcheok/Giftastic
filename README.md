# Giftastic

This is an app that starts with about 20 buttons containing names of animals. On clicking any of the buttons,
it would bring up 10 gifs of the animals pulled from the Giphy API. The user can then add their own animal
button to click on.

The user can then choose to favourite any of their gifs which are then stored at the bottom of the screen.
The favourites are stored in local storage in the browser and would be available for the user on subsequent visits.
